## Installation

Installation is very simple, you can just download the update set **pe-feedback-card-update-set.xml** and install it on your instance. Then the widget is available for you to drag and drop on your page.

There are 3 steps for feedback, and to make the it easy for to swap messaging on each step we are providing 3 options.

**"Step 1 message"** the default message for this is **We would like you to take a survey to see how we are doing.**

**"Step 2 message"** the default message for this is **How would you rate your overall experience using this?**

**"Step 3 message"** the default message for this is **People like you rate this service at:**

***

We provide three SASS variables to control the Background Color, Text/Emoji Color, Messaging Text Size

`$pe-brand-primary: #337ab7 !default;`

`$pe-brand-text-color: #fff !default;`

`$pe-brand-text-size-normal: 15px !default;`



You can override these variables at portal level using the **themes**.
