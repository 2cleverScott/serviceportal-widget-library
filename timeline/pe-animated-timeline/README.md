This can be used to quickly craft an animated timeline widget.

## Installation

Installation is very simple, you can just download the update set "pe-animated-timeline.u-update-set.xml" and install it on your instance. Then the widget is available for you to drag and drop on your page.

## Sass Variables

We provide two Sass variables to control the state of the timeline.

`$pe-brand-success: #57c446 !default;`

`$pe-brand-error: #ff0000 !default;`
