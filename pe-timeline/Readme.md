## Synopsis

This widget can be used to quickly opbtain an initial implementation of a timeline.


## Installation

Installation is very simple, you can just download the update set "pe-timeline-update-set.xml" and install it on your instance. Then the widget is available for you to drag and drop on your page.

We provide few options to load data easily and also to change the appearance of the widget.

**"Title"** This is for changing the title in the header

***

We provide four SASS variables to control the color of the statistics shown in the timeline (both text and icon):

`$pe-timeline-items-color: #ff6f00 !default;`

You can overide these variables at portal level using the **themes**.
