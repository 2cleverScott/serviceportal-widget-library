## Synopsis: Timeline Widget Variation Used In Employee Experience

![alt text](../images/pe-timeline-emp-exp.png "Timeline Widget")


This widget can be used to implement timeline.

## Installation

Installation is very simple, you can just download the update set "pe-timeline-emp-exp.xml" and install it on your instance. Then the widget is available for you to drag and drop on your page.

We provide few options to load data easily and also to change the appearance of the widget.

**"Show Left Descriptions"** This is for displaying a text on the left for each element in the timeline. This is false for us.

***

We provide four SASS variables to control the color of the statistics shown in the timeline (both text and icon):

`$pe-timeline-items-color: #ff6f00 !default;`

You can override these variables at portal level using the **themes**.
