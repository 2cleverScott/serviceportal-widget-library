There is one option and a sample data set available in the Server script resource.

We provide three SASS variables to control the Background Color and Text Color

`$pe-brand-widget-bg-color: #2f65bc !default;`

`$pe-brand-widget-text-color: #e5efff !default;`

You can override these variables at portal level using the **themes**.
